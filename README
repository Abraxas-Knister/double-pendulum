Hi folks

Did this out of fun, posted first to
https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/c0m0bg/programmed_a_simulation_of_the_double_pendulum/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
now I've made a git repo out of it because people wanted it.

Have fun!

Try out doing a rollback to first commit if you want to see some very interesting movements =] There the EOM
weren't exact so one can see some really strange accelerations.

Req:
python3 for data, gnuplot for the gif, make

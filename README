Hi folks

Did this out of fun, posted first to
https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/c0m0bg/programmed_a_simulation_of_the_double_pendulum/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
now I've made a git repo out of it because people wanted it.

Have fun!
Double Pendulum is nice!

Try out doing a rollback to first commit if you want to see some very interesting movements =]
